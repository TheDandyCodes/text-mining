Clearly, occupation is an\n   undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. \n\nOk, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the \nIsraelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.\nFrom your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred\nthat you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the\nreason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of \noccupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this\n'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.\n\n   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to\n   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing\n   Palestinean human rights.\n\nI'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.\n\n\n   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \n   |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n\n   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.\n\nOh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?\nDoes the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and\nTurkey? \nHow about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in\nthe Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?\nDo the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?\n\n\n   |>    |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?\n   |> \n   |>    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem.

Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your \n   |> reply.\n\n   So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.\n   (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).\n\nNo, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper \nwould probably lead to disaster for both parties. If that's what you refer \nto as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it.\n\n   |>    Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) \n   |>    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:\n   |> \t   \"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both\n   |> \t   peoples together in this country....

Clearly, occupation is an\n   undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. \n\nOk, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the \nIsraelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.\nFrom your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred\nthat you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the\nreason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of \noccupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this\n'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.\n\n   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to\n   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing\n   Palestinean human rights.\n\nI'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.\n\n   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \n   |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.\n\nOh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?\nDoes the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and\nTurkey? \nHow about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in\nthe Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?\nDo the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?\n\n   |>    |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?\n   |> \n   |>    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem.

Center for Regional Studies\nDate: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 12:12:25 GMT\nLines: 223\n\n\nDEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]\n\n\n          Born 1972\n          Attended 9th Grade\n          Middle School No. 17\n\n          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25\n          Microdistrict No. 3\n          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\nReally, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came \nhome from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \ncousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \nthat I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\n\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \ntaken for Armenians.\n\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \nbuilding where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was \npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking\npassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\n\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call \nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, \nthat's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very \nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \nthere weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\nAvakian was killed, too.\n\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We \nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\ndecided she had already left.\n\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\n\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \ncould do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He \nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \nhad knives and steel truncheons.\n\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if\nI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\npush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\n\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \nstrike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \nlose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \ntheir balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is \nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\n\nWe were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, \nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a \nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \naway, and everything will be OK.\n\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \no'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are \nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\n\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\nbefore the 27th.\n\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \nthat they were dead. My father's older brother told me.\n\nMy father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\n\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\n\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \ncalled from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of \nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \nyears old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\n\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from \nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\n\n\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\n\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\n\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\n\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\n\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \nArmenia.\n\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\ncan do that.\n\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\n\nYou can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \nin the hands of our government.\n\nJune 13,1988\n\nStepanakert \n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\n\nWe were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, \nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a \nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \naway, and everything will be OK.\n\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \no'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are \nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\n\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\nbefore the 27th.\n\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \nthat they were dead. My father's older brother told me.\n\nMy father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\n\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\n\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \ncalled from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of \nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \nyears old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\n\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from \nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\n\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\n\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\n\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\n\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\n\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \nArmenia.\n\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\ncan do that.\n\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\n\nYou can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \nin the hands of our government.\n\nJune 13,1988\n\nStepanakert \n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

         "historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian populations even the nazis did this much is the world community really so powerless where are all those human rights advocates where are all the decent people are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it the number of azeris murdered by the terrorist armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing news reporters make their living by providing stories and there is so way in hell that they are going to confuse the public with what is happening in armenia a country that few know of and risk detracting people 's interest from what is happening in serbia then you must be living in an alternate universe where were they an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union all humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter universal declaration of human rights helsinki agreements human problems international forums documents signed by the soviet union all of them are violated the ussr 's president government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace the 140,000 strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow 's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against azerbaijan as a result a part of azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded some 200,000 azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the armenian ssr their historical homeland together with them 64,000 russians and 22,000 kurds have also been driven out a part of them now settled in azerbaijan some 40,000 turkish meskhetians lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the armenian extremists destruction of the karabakh scientific experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of 7 million azerbaijanis are violated its territory culture and history are trampled its people are shot there is persistent negative image of azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media armenian lobby in the ussr and the united states one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr we are for a united indivisible sovereign azerbaijan we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic muhammed emin rasulzade but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new 1,000 year reich the great armenia by annexing the neighboring lands the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent but what about the lives of seven million human beings if these people are muslims does it mean that they are less valuable can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion our previous appeals were unheard however we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins the committee for people 's help to karabakh of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr everyone knows this even the turks know this you know this give us a time period when the world is currently boring and what is happening in armenia would make front page headlines think i 'm lying take a look at what happened in somalia when did the press report it to the world but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus in the name of peace and democracy the armenians are christians the azerbaijanis are moslems and islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat westernizers besides at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on azerbaijan a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent azeri people hundreds of thousands of refugees and gross violations of human rights recently armenians attacked the azeri town of khojaly and massacred thousands of azeris the paris based association for democracy and human rights in azerbaijan puts the number of khojali victims at 3,145 some of the dead were scalped and mutilated this whole thing has now gone entirely too far want to know what will bring the story in armenia to the front page if the russians move into the area with a shit load of tanks then your human rights

reminded of the genocide of the armenians for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by s. orel and s. yuca of the turkish historical society if one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the

In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \n\n>Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:\n\nCome again?\n\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n>(34 lines deleted)\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \n\n>Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:\n\nCome again?\n\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n>(34 lines deleted)\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

these armenian guerrilla forces operating in close coordination with the russians were savagely attacking turkish cities towns and villages in the east massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time working to sabotage the ottoman army 's war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease russian occupation the atrocities committed by the armenian volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties the memoirs of many russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these armenian guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of war then observed in such areas.[1 1 journal de guerre du deuxieme d'artillerie de forteresse russe d'erzeroum 1919 p. 28 honored me by reproducing my text unfortunately he has still not produced the documents on jews in latvia instead he asks for my views on the turkish genocide well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred other threads i 'll let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk mutlu argic cosar a net wide terrorism triangle and their spurious evidence when that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a non fascist x soviet armenian government in the east now where is your non existent list of scholars what a moronian during the first world war and the ensuing years 1914 1920 the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland this paragraph is well written and interesting serdar baby but it has nothing to do with jews in latvia i have not presented a list of scholars how could you because there is none i am not interested in an ex soviet why do you write x- it 's very cute armenian government non fascist or otherwise you are not responding to what i am writing instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit like conversing with a brick wall and you are not responding to what i am writing by the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people for nearly one thousand years the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation the persecutions culminated in 1914 the armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects 2.5 million turks and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland after one thousand years turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye today x soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x soviet armenia today x soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity x soviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds you have now done so four times in a row may i legitimately conclude that you are not indeed a regular net user but an auto posting computer program which for convenience i have called mutlu.exe you may assert whatever you wish here we go with mutlu.exe 's famed list of sources ditto the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an

collaboration during world war ii anything to add no darling read what i post other people are asking you about the turkish genocide i am asking you to produce the documents on jews in latvia no matter how many times you erase what i post i will still post the same question post the documents on jews in latvia do not autopost the same block of text about the turkish genocide remember the issue at hand is the armenian nazi collaboration during world war ii and the turkish genocide and i still fail to see how you can challenge the following western sources source john dewey the new

expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population i want

their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire

We can get back to the \nquestion of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have \nnot adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.\n\n   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my\n   point in the post, that you \"responded to\". The point is that since Israel \n   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights \n   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic \n   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.\n\nIf a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \ntell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others \n   |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or \n   |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights. \n\n   |> Such as the right to live?

Does that give me the right to kill\n   |> them?\n\n   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?\n\nWorthy or not, I was just applying your logic to a related problem.\nAm I to assume you admit it wouldn't hold?\n\n   |> |> What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue?\n   |> |> The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law,\n   |> |> US law, Israeli law ,...\n\n   |> And now it's very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a \n   |> point.. Excuse me while I throw up.\n\n   ok, Master of Wisdom is throwing up. \n   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !\n\nOh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?\nI'll let you in on a secret... It's not for real.. Take my word for it.\n\n   |> |> It seems that the US law -represented by US State dept in this case-\n   |> |> is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories.\n   |> |> Anyway, as for Hamas, then obviously they turned to the islamic system.\n\n   |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?\n\n   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem.

eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be use in the territory later also you have not adresse my question if the israelis also have human right first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizen in the wb revoke their right of life but it say the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizen basically revoke the right of for its military man clearly occupation be an undeclared war during war attack against military target be fully legitimate secondly surely israeli have human right but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdraw from the occupied terretorie not by further oppress palestinean human right what do you expect i to tell you master of wisdom when i do explain my point in the post that you respond to the point be that since israel be occupy then it be automatically deprive itself from some of its right to the occupied palestineans which be exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it be citizen of human right by its action then tell i why any human living today should have any right at all because not all state be like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant what kind of right and how much would be deprive be another issue the answer be to be find in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law |>[delete jonas be throw up not for real so you can stick to the screen it seem that the us law -represente by us state dept in this case- be look to the other way around when violence occur in occupy territory anyway as for hamas then obviously they turn to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question be not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the law of minister sharon say kick palestineans out of here all palestine i ask for which system should be use that will preserve human right for all people involve i assume that be obvious but i will not repeat that mistake now that i have straighten that out i be eagerly await your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human right i be understand this from your first statement in this paragraph joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization say it well when write in his diary in 1940 between ourselves it must be clear that there be no room for both people together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of be an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution be a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there be no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring country to transfer all of they not one village not one tribe should be leave only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the million of our own brother there be no other way out davar

withdraw from the occupied terretorie not by further oppress palestinean human right i be sorry but the above sentence do not make sense please rephrase it i donot know about you but it make full sense to i israelis be be kill because israel be occupy let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be save it isnot the palestinean who undermine the right of life of israelis but it be israel which occupy and expose the life of its citizen to the the unconcluded war of 1967 more generally the violence in the occupied terretorie be part of the intifada and i have previously post a long article about this issue whom i finish by an open question suppose the intifada stop what be the motive for israel to withdraw donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit everybody in the world look and hope for peace so why isnot there any hope of peace be necessary but not sufficient motive if a state can deprive all it be citizen of human right by its action then tell i why any human living today should have any right at all because not all state be like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human right of the syrians iraqis and other do the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurd in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetche the russians in the baltic state or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serb have any human right remainaing accord to you as for the arabian country their problem be an arabian concern the arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene as for serbs i donot think that those fucked up rapists excuse my language but it really hurt as much if i be in bosnia itself arenot human those surely come from outer space or something no human can allow himself to see such attrocitie than to participate in and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question be not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the law of minister sharon say kick palestineans out of here all palestine i ask for which system should be use that will preserve human right for all people involve i assume that be obvious but i will not repeat that mistake now that i have straighten that out i be eagerly await your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human right i be understand this from your first statement in this paragraph no i be agree that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both party if that be what you refer to as the israeli solution then so be it ok joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization say it well when write in his diary in 1940 between ourselves it must be clear that there be no room for both people together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of be an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution be a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there be no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring country to transfer all of they not one village not one tribe should be leave only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the million of our own brother there be no other way out davar 29 september 1967 courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we be to disregard the rather obvious reference to get israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that be the english translation if you have other information i would be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even old i be not go to get into the question if he write the above but it be fairly obvious all party in the conflict have their share of fanatic guess what those be not the people that will make any last peace in the region more delete stuff exactly you be right i guess that the problem be that the israeli goverment be full with man like joseph weitz oh have you meet with they personally to read their diary fascinating what do you do for a living we and our either refer to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solve the me problem i think that be fair enough no that be not an answer since i ask for a system that could solve the problem you say any could be use then you provide a contradiction above you write that you understand what i mean underline by any system can be use to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a non solution per definition no my definition be the same as your but one have to look into the world politic in politic a solution doesnot imply just solution you say the following for all a it hold that a have property b. there exist an a such that property b do not hold thus either or both statement must be false guess where that take your logic to never never land you be prove yourself as a first you understand what i mean but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i be merely point out a not so small flaw in your reasoning since you claim to be logical i feel it good to point this out before you start use your statement to prove a point or so be i then to assume you be not logical it seem that it be problem in the definition of solution i think a solution must be just because otherwise it would never be last however when politician say a solution they donot mean a just solution but just a solution the great problem of zionism be arab child -rabbi shoham oh and by the way let i add that these cute quote you put at the end be a real bummer when i try give your post any credit why do you feel ashamed by thing and fact that you believe in if you be a zionists if you believe in zionist code and act well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham have say yes zionism be racism if you feel ashamed and bother by the zionist code then drop zionism if you be not zionist why be you bother then you should join i in condemn these racist zionist code and act any quote can be misuse especially when use to stereotype all individual by a statement of an individual if you use the same method that you credit zionist with then where do that place you oh by the way i would advice you not to assume anything about my loyalty i will and be condemn act i find vile and inhuman but i will try as long as i can not to assume those act be by a whole people by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leader of israel political and/or religious or the jews in general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel if we start condemn you personally base on the bombing in egypt jonas flygare hasan",
         "sorry guys for this long article but in fact it is mostly quotings |>when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that |>the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate |>and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on |>the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i 'm merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate ok let me re phrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians well if you just waited for 5 more lines you would have read my statement secondly surely israeli have human rights but and if so why because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i 'd like you to define the term so i do n't have to repeat this drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli

There \nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \nto Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded \na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we've \nscared them enough, let's leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \nand it was dark . . .\n\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially \nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to \nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \nwasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \nlive literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \ndriver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \nhe said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \nOK . . .\n\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to \ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \nnothing had happened.\n\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and \ndidn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't\nguess.\n\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\nhome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \nZimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\nour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \nare they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \nthat, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \ncabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\non in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see \nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \nWe cleared the table.\n\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \nsee what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\nsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \nan Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\nthat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \nfeet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\ngot up and left or not.\n\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \nkept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \nthem.\n\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \nand it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \ndin and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \nshouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\nsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \nthey'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \nthat we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \nthat I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \nher anything or not.\n\nThen . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \ncommanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \nin front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \nthemselves who would go first.\n\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \nHe looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \nwindows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\nI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \ndon't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\nelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n \nI come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \nclothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \nhe's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\nthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \nbrought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \nand what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \nto tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \nthere. So they survived.\n\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \nin the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \nand we'll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I'll stay at your place because of\nwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n\nI came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \ncame to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \nsimply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \nit was hard to breathe . . .\n\nMy supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \nwithout stopping. After us.\n\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\nfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. \nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\nquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" At that moment \nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \nhere, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \nthe soldiers said, \"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \nDaghestan police were there.\n\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \nknow what to do with the rest.\"\n\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \nboss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \nambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \nthink of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \nthem.\n\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \nyour brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\nward.\n\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \ncouldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\nthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \nArmenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\nthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \nand off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \nafter that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \nI didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \ncould. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \nwho didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\nmyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \nfrom all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \nThere was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\nbreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\nwasn't cut.\n\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \nclub that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \nright and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \ntheater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \nthe attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \ncouldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \neyes.\n\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\nthey should have, with their IDs.\n\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \nalready in the city.\n\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \nfamilies. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \nnow to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\ngasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\nMicrodistrict 3.\n\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \nthe corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\nG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \nshe still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \ncarried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.\n\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \ncouldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\nshe couldn't remember anyone's face.\n\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\nout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\nthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the \nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \nmeetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\n\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our\ncase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\nthe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \npeople, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were\nall from Kafan.\n\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't \nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina \nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out \nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \nwe're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\nhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not \nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn't at home, my family and \nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is \nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \nthat Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \nhead I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the \nsame time\n\nI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one\nwasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\nexactly I can't say.                                                     \n\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, \nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \ndormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\n\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come \nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \nthey've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been\nbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he \nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\n\nI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. \nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \ncurfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, \nI can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, \nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and \nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have \nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they \nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our \napartment.\n\nI don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been \nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You'll come in this entryway over my dead\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't \neven know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well\nwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They \ncouldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \nstopped them.\n\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \nMaybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is \nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\ndidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\" \nOnly they didn't shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\n\nThat's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find\nLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\nbut they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\ncourage to . . .\n\nA boy said to my mother \"Where's the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to \nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \n\"What's happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \nfind out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or \nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out \nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\nher mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \nway to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it\nhappened in.\n\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting \nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \nless calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I \ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\nlet's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how \nlong we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\" I don't get it, all\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \nfor? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\nsays, \"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the \nnight at someone else's.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \nshouts, \"Come back, they're coming!\" They didn't have enough time to get a \nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his \nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \nthey're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\n\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\nAsya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \nsomething like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who \nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but \nthey didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up \nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren't you taking anything from this \napartment?\" He says, \"I don't need anything.\" And the women who were standing \nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \nmad, and he says, \"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\ndirection.\n\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \njust didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \nshe didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where's the girl who was here?\"\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \nthe basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n\nAfter that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \ndidn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \nwho sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \nthat they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \nstanding on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\nyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\nThat trick didn't work on them.\n\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \nthat it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \nAnd no one did anything. Anything.\n\n   April 25, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

[1]\n\nBorn 1964\nSecretary-Typist\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\n\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\nMicrodistrict No. 3\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation \nwhatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There \nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \nto Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded \na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we've \nscared them enough, let's leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \nand it was dark . . .\n\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially \nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to \nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \nwasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \nlive literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \ndriver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \nhe said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \nOK . . .\n\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to \ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \nnothing had happened.\n\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and \ndidn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't\nguess.\n\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\nhome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \nZimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\nour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \nare they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \nthat, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \ncabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\non in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see \nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \nWe cleared the table.\n\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \nsee what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\nsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \nan Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\nthat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \nfeet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\ngot up and left or not.\n\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \nkept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \nthem.\n\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \nand it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \ndin and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \nshouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\nsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \nthey'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \nthat we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \nthat I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \nher anything or not.\n\nThen . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \ncommanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \nin front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \nthemselves who would go first.\n\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \nHe looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \nwindows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\nI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \ndon't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\nelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n \nI come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \nclothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \nhe's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\nthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \nbrought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \nand what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \nto tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \nthere. So they survived.\n\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \nin the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \nand we'll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I'll stay at your place because of\nwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n\nI came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \ncame to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \nsimply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \nit was hard to breathe . . .\n\nMy supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \nwithout stopping. After us.\n\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\nfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. \nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\nquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" At that moment \nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \nhere, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \nthe soldiers said, \"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \nDaghestan police were there.\n\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \nknow what to do with the rest.\"\n\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \nboss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \nambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \nthink of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \nthem.\n\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \nyour brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\nward.\n\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \ncouldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\nthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \nArmenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\nthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \nand off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \nafter that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \nI didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \ncould. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \nwho didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\nmyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \nfrom all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \nThere was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\nbreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\nwasn't cut.\n\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \nclub that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \nright and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \ntheater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \nthe attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \ncouldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \neyes.\n\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\nthey should have, with their IDs.\n\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \nalready in the city.\n\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \nfamilies. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \nnow to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\ngasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\nMicrodistrict 3.\n\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \nthe corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\nG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \nshe still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \ncarried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.\n\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \ncouldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\nshe couldn't remember anyone's face.\n\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\nout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\nthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the \nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \nmeetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\n\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our\ncase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\nthe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \npeople, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were\nall from Kafan.\n\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't \nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina \nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out \nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \nwe're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\nhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not \nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn't at home, my family and \nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is \nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \nthat Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \nhead I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the \nsame time\n\nI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one\nwasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\nexactly I can't say.                                                     \n\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, \nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \ndormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\n\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come \nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \nthey've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been\nbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he \nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\n\nI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. \nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \ncurfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, \nI can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, \nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and \nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have \nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they \nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our \napartment.\n\nI don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been \nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You'll come in this entryway over my dead\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't \neven know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well\nwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They \ncouldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \nstopped them.\n\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \nMaybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is \nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\ndidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\" \nOnly they didn't shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\n\nThat's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find\nLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\nbut they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\ncourage to . . .\n\nA boy said to my mother \"Where's the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to \nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \n\"What's happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \nfind out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or \nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out \nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\nher mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \nway to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it\nhappened in.\n\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting \nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \nless calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I \ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\nlet's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how \nlong we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\" I don't get it, all\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \nfor? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\nsays, \"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the \nnight at someone else's.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \nshouts, \"Come back, they're coming!\" They didn't have enough time to get a \nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his \nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \nthey're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\n\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\nAsya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \nsomething like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who \nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but \nthey didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up \nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren't you taking anything from this \napartment?\" He says, \"I don't need anything.\" And the women who were standing \nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \nmad, and he says, \"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\ndirection.\n\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \njust didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \nshe didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where's the girl who was here?\"\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \nthe basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n\nAfter that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \ndidn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \nwho sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \nthat they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \nstanding on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\nyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\nThat trick didn't work on them.\n\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \nthat it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \nAnd no one did anything. Anything.\n\n   April 25, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

ready mamma say let she eat with we then she can go we sit down at the table but no one be hungry no one be in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we be eat we turn on the television and the show in fairy tale land be come on we clear the table we hear some noise out in the courtyard i go out on the balcony but i can not see what be go on because the noise be come from the direction of the bus station and there be a 9 story building in the way there be mob of people i can not figure out what be happen they be shout something look somewhere i can not make out what be go on i go down to a neighbor she be an azerbaijani we have be friend of her family for about 25 year i go down to look from their place i see people shout look at the 5 and 9 story building near the bus station just then soldier set upon they about 20 people with club the mob run off in different direction i even see several people from our building they be look and laugh i decide that mean it be not all that bad if they be laugh it mean they be not kill anyone but now the crowd suddenly dash toward the soldier one of the soldier can not manage to get away they start stomp on he with their foot everyone be kick he i become ill and go home and explain in general term that horrible thing be go on out there can not speak well they have probably kill that soldier the way that crowd be if each of they kick he just once they take his club away from he and start to beat he with it but it be far away and i could not see if he get up and leave or not i become terrified and go home and say lyuda do not go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd run over close toward our building and stand at the 12 story building and start shout something we go out onto the balcony all of our neighbor be also out on theirs too everyone be stand stare the mob be shout and about 5 minute later come run toward our building as it turn out at the 12 story build the azerbaijani neighbor go down and keep they from come in there be only one entryway there they could stop they they all run up to our building mamma immediately start close the window afraid that they might throw stone they have stone and they break the window all of they there be very many people we have a large courtyard and it be pack with people they spill up to the first floor so they do not crush each other they crawl up on tree post and garage it be just a huge cloud of people they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building we close the window and immediately hear tramping in our entryway they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar it be incomprehensible mamma tell i later that they be shout father 's name grisha open the door we have come to kill you or something like that i do not remember that i be space out kind of mamma say into the bedroom quickly in the bedroom we have two tall bed part of our dowry mamma say hide there they probably will not come in there they will ask something say something and leave she say we will tell they that we live alone here i can not imagine that my parent will stand out in the hall alone talk with some sort of beast i go to they and say that i will stand together with they i will talk with they if they come maybe i can find a common language with they all the more so if they know i i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i tell marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i can not remember if i tell she anything or not then they open the door it be like they blow on it and it break and fall right into the hall the crow burst in and start to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia thing like that i tell they what have happen speak calmly one of you tell i calmly what have happen in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave i say ok go downstairs we will gather everything we need and leave the apartment i realize that it be senseless to discuss any sort of right with they these be animal they must be stop the one stand in the doorway the young guy say there be old people and one girl with they too bad they take two or three step back it seem as though i have pacify they with our exchange then someone in the courtyard shout command they do not you understand what you be say kill they and that be it that be all it take they grab papa carry he into one room and mamma and i into another they put mamma on the bed and start undress she beat her leg they start tear my clothe right there in front of mamma i do not remember where they go what they do or how much time pass i have the feeling that they beat i on the head on my body and tear my clothe all at the same time i do not even know what i say the atrocity start i be savagely rape in that room they argue among themselves who would go first later i remember i come to i do not know if i be dead or alive someone come in someone tall i think clean shaven in an eskimo dogskin coat bald he look around at what be happen at that instant everything stop it seem to i that he be either their commander or that somehow everything depend on he he look and say well we be do here they be beat mamma on the head they break up the chair and beat she with the chair leg she lose consciousness and they decide that she be dead papa be out cold they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they can not get the window open apparently the window frame be stick after the rain and the window can not be open they leave she next to the window she be think about be throw out the window and pass out she be not a real strong person anyway he look at i and see that i be say something that i be still twitch well i start say the opposite of what i should be which be humble myself and plead i start shout curse they do not get any entreaty out of i i already know that i be dead why would i humble myself before anyone and he say that if that be what i think since my tongue be so long maybe he think that i still look quite appeal in short he command that i be take outside i no long see or remember what be happen to marina and lyuda i do not know if they be alive or not they take i outside they be drag i by my arm by my leg they be hit i against the wall the railing something metal while they be carry i someone be bite i someone else be pinch i .i do not even know i think my god when will death come if only it be soon then they carry i out throw i near the entryway and start kick i i lose consciousness what happen after that how many people there be i do not remember i come to after a while i do not remember how long a neighbor be bring i clothing i be entirely cover with blood she put a dress on i i remember that i say the same word over and over again mamma what happen mamma what have they do to we where be we whose house be we at i can not make sense out of anything there be a guy stand over i i sort of know he he serve in afghanistan his name be igor he bring i indoor when they all go to the third entryway and kill a person there igor gather his courage take i into his arm and bring i to the neighbor even though he be small minded he put himself at risk igor agayev be azerbaijani he serve in afghanistan there be three

out from under the bed marina lyuda say that she be russian they say we will let you go we be not touch the russians go and while they be drag marina out she decide she be go to tell they she be azerbaijani igor immediately grab marina 's and lyuda 's hand because he know marina and know that she be armenian and be our sister and take she to the second floor to a neighbor 's and start pound on the door so she will open up she open the door and igor push they in there so they survive my sister lyuda lose consciousness after the bandit start steal thing while they be go downstairs take thing downstairs then come back up again lyuda seize the opportunity and crawl under the bed and stay there then when she be herself again she find a tear night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and go to a neighbor 's on the fourth floor the one whose apartment i have watch the crowd from the friend of ours and knock on the door the neighbor open and say i be not go to let you in the apartment because i be afraid of they but i will give you some stocking and we will leave the building lyuda say i will stay at your place because of what be go on they keep go up and down the stair it be just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor would not consent lyuda come back to our place and lie under the bed i come to mother be there i can not remember my supervisor 's telephone number but something have to be do somehow i remember and call and he come to get we he do not have any idea what be go on he think we be simply afraid he do not know that they be kill we and that we have pass between life and death he come and get we and take we to the police precinct there they look we over i be have trouble walk my lung hurt badly it be hard to breathe my supervisor 's name be urshan feyruzovich mamedov he be the head of our administration they take we there when we be leave i see a great number of bus full of soldier at the entrance to town the bus be ordinary passenger bus there be very many soldier we leave around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what be happen they could save a great many life because the crowd be move on toward the school and what be go on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murder they all one after the next without stop after we i think 14 people die in microdistrict no 3 and 10 to 12 of they be from building 4 5 and 6 in our building one person die and one old woman die from building 16 that be the building in front of our there young azerbaijani man stop the mob and would not let it into their building incidentally when we be at the neighbor marina call our relative to warn they so they would all know what be happen i call a aunt in microdistrict no 5 they have three neighbor who be armenians i say run quickly i can not explain what be go on hide do what you can just stay alive hide at azerbaijanis one who will not give you away at that moment three people come in policeman i think they be azerbaijanis i be in such awful condition my face be completely distort my lip be puff up there be blood my eye be swollen no one think i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead be badly cut and one half of my face be push out forward no one would have think that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i start to scream at those people why do you come who send you here no one want you here have not you kill people people yet what be you do here one of the soldier say do not scream at we we be muslims but we be not from the sumgait police they call in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police be there when we get to the police precinct there be an awful lot of police there there be soldier police with dog ambulance fireman i do not know maybe they be wait for people to bring they the goner and the seriously injure to treat they there in the police precinct i do not know what they be there for there be also doctor from baku there they examine lyuda and i and say these woman need to go to the maternity home but we do not know what to do with the rest so they take we and i lose contact with my parent my boss everyone my boss say do not worry i will find you no matter where you be no matter what happen we go to the hospital there we be examine by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name be she examine we the ambulance be from baku i figure out that the sumgait ambulance have not do anything they do not respond to any call people call and neither the police nor the ambulance show any sign of life that doctor look i over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good have happen for she become quite glad i even think to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad be wrong she look i over and say now why be you suffer so you do not know what your people have be do your people do even bad thing and i think great i have to deal with she and i feel so bad i think why do not i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like she here i be in this condition and be tell about something that our people do i just do not have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours have not already do i stay there then they bring in another woman ira b. she be marry and she be rape in her own apartment too there be three of we ira lyuda and 1 the next morning they take lyuda and ira away they do not do anything to help we this be in the old maternity home in the combine block they do not do anything more than examine i that be it i do not want any shot or tranquilizer nothing what shot could have calm i down i do not even want to look at they i lie in the ward either it just work out that way or they do it on pur- pose but i be alone i be alone even though the ward be pack that same evening a woman come by and ask i what be wrong with i that my face be disfigure she ask what have happen to i and i say well to ask your brother what happen there be no point in ask i your brother can well explain what happen she fall into a faint all the doctor throw themselves at she and the doctor categorically forbid anyone to come into my ward then people from work come to see i my boss his daughter they bring i clothing because i be literally naked the only thing i have on be a dress but the woman who give it to i be very short and the dress be way up above my knee and the woman orderly say i can not believe you put on such a short dress who be you show off your leg to here i go back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work come and bring i something in a sack apple i think three or four pound but i could not take they i have become so weak that it be just embarrassing i say that i could not take the apple and really do not have any appetite no one have to bring i anything some woman take the sack and oh yes then i hear that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hide or tear up completely so that no one would know that i be an armenian maybe they would not figure it out from look at i so they must have be think that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be bad or perhaps someone be outside on the street i do not know in any case i do not sleep a wink that night the next morning they pick i up a whole police detail put i in a bus and off we go i do not even know where they be take i they take i to the club where the troop be the very one i be in that ill fated evening i get off the bus near the city party committee there be a great many troop tank armored personnel carrier the whole scene be terrible i see a few people i know there and that calm i a little i have already think that i be the only one left so there be five or six of we leave in sumgait after that night i still do not know what happen to my parent they do not come to see i in the hospital and my boss tell i that everything be fine i do not know whether to believe he or not maybe he be just try to calm i down maybe something happen on the way then i go to the club and see a lot of people i know they all know one another they be all kiss each other and ask what happen what go on two day later they come to see i from work they be there all the time each day they come show interest and be constantly bring i money they do everything they could of course i be most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleague who do not lose his presence of mind and who do not change his opinion neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happen he constantly take an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two day later the secretary of the party committee come not from our party organization but from the first trust which our be part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he make arrangement with the emergency medical personnel to take i away because if i sit down by myself i could not get up or lie down again there be something wrong with my lung it be hard to breathe they examine i there several time there i lie be several doctor they all think that that it must just be from all the blow i do not know they do not diagnose anything in particular when i be in the maternity home i even ask i make it a point of insist that they take i to the trauma section because i feel so awful there be no way something inside be not break my rib well they take i there and take x ray and say that everything be fine there be emergency medical worker on duty in the club the mother of one of marina 's friend be there she be the head doctor at the sumgait children 's clinic they have every kind of antifever agent in the world which be exactly what i need at that moment i think i say that i be have great difficulty breathing i could not seem to get enough air something be wrong with i they put tight bandage around my chest and waist later i overheard some people say that i have be cut all over i think they just see i be all bandage up and decide that my breast and face have be cut but i be not cut they take we to the khimik boarding house we live there a long time soon appear representative they be agitate at first people would not talk to they and drive they off one of the armenian woman shout we demand that seidov come the response be it be seidov who send we seidov be the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman say we will only see seidov 's daughter have she come here we will do the same thing to she that they do to our daughter and then we will deal with you agitator and so on more of they say have seidov himself come this go on day in day out the agitator keep come and come this drive we out of our wit then people gradually start depart for yerevan because they realize it be senseless to stay everything get on our nerve the smell the small child there be child at the sk club child who have literally just come out of the maternity home what be they do in a club that do not even have run water all the time at first we have to pay to eat there they even overcharge we as it turn out on the second day someone tell we that they would bring we food for free the child be ill everything stank there well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500 you could not sit or lie down it be impossible to even move the stench be awful even the small infant take ill overnight there i hear that they be arrive seriously ill in yerevan the infant they have to be wash they have to be bathe not to mention that we the adult be ill and need care people be faint right and leave i just do not know everyone be cry everyone only the young people the man somehow manage to keep it together but the woman be in a constant state of panic it seem to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seem clear that we have be gather together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there would not be a single armenian left then people go up to the attic i do not see they i only hear they because i be lie down and could not get up i lay right on the stage we have some room there apparently they catch two people with either oil or gas i think they want to burn the theater maybe someone see they i do not i be in no condition to open my eye everyone be suspicious of everyone else they would ask be not you an azerbaijani i think i see you somewhere i think you be an azerbaijani they lead out all the man and start let they back in by check their passport relative might be cover for each other half of the people do not have any document there be people who have run out of their home in nothing but a pair of pant and slipper or wear just a shirt not like they should have with their id so on the 28th on sunday i think the police do nothing to help we on monday everything resume where it have leave off on block 41a. they do not spare a soul there not child not pregnant woman nobody they kill they burn they hack with axis just everything possible they murder the melkumian family whom i know my mother work with they their daughter- in law go to school with my old sister they be brutally murder only the two daughter in law survive by a miracle one be able to save herself she run away the neighbor would not take she in so she run about the building until she find refuge she be pregnant and have two small child this all continue on monday in block 41a on the 29th when the troop be already in the city they murder people they overturn automobile and they burn entire family they say they do not even know for sure if the people be armenians or not i hear that the lezgin suffer too i be not sure myself i do not see any lezgin who have be injure they burn car so it be very difficult now to say exactly who die and who do not it be very difficult to identify the corpse or rather what remain of the corpse after they be douse in gasoline and burn it be all very hard to imagine of course i hear that many people disappear without a trace from the btz plant two people include a woman who work the night shift aunt razmella who also live in microdistrict 3 they be stop bus between baku and sumgait in the evening people who have be visit baku be return to sumgait and people from baku be go home from sumgait and there be student too they be simply savagely murder they be stop the bus the driver immediately do what they be tell because there be just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stop the bus drag the armenians out and kill they on the spot i do not see it myself but i hear that they put they all in a pile so as to burn they later it be hard to discern from the corpse well you can not call they corpse you have to figure out from the ashe who it be l hear that two fellow save two woman one a student ira g. if i be not mistaken she be in the hospital a long time after that and she still can not figure out who save she she be also brutally rape and beat and throw onto a pile of corpse the fellow pull she out of that whole pile of corpse put his coat on she take she into his arm and carry she to the city i still can not imagine how he manage to do that i hear that from engels grigorian he know she apparently well a lot of people go to that hospital anyway she be in the hospital and singe a song in armenian and they write the word down and i think he still have that piece of paper because he say that a lot of people now have that song the one she sing in the hospital where she lie in such bad shape they could not find the guy who save she he leave she in someone 's apartment and call the ambulance she be in such awful shape that probably like i she could not remember anyone 's face i think that i know one of the people who break into our house maybe i have talk with he once but i receive so many blow everything be just knock out of my head i can not remember to this day who he be then it seem i see the secretary of the directorate 's party organization where marina work she go to school and work she go to night school at azi and work by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration i be the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often meet with the secretary of party and komsomol organization we have joint meeting i know they all i have even talk with they and he i know be from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it become obvious that many of those people be azerbaijanis bear in armenia they take i to various police station to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy get involve in the case and i iden- tifie the photograph of people who i could more or less recognize they show i the people who be in our apartment they be work on our case but i can not even recognize they although it be prove that they be the one they be process it somehow they tell i that they know that someone hold i by the arm and someone else hold i by the leg when they be drag i there be someone else in our apartment who do not even touch i he just steal a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of they as much as i have hear about they and see they they be all from kafan the secretary of the party organization be name najaf najaf rzayev he be there when everything start it must have be he because i do not recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i know besides he all the more since i tell he listen you do something because you know i he turn away and go toward the bedroom where marina be well you could not see marina anyway there be such a noisy confusion of people that you could not make out anyone all of it fly right out of my head and then gradually i become myself again at the city party committee there be military people there i tell they what go on and they write it all down i tell they his name on march 8 the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we be part of come to see we his name be najaf rzayev i tell mamma if he be here despite the fact that i give his name it mean that either his alibi have be confirm or probably that they think i be crazy not responsible for my word he say what do they do to you how awful myself i hide an armenian family then after some time go by he come back again and say something entirely different i be not at home my family and i go to baku i say marina what be he say he say something totally different before after that i do not go to see our procurator our case be be handle by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov tell i that rzayev 's case have just get to he and there be so name involve what be they do with rzayev do he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i be hit in the head i can not say anything for sure whether it be he or not it will be an insult if he be in our apartment and do not have to pay for it but at the same time i be afraid to say i be a hundred percent sure that it be he because no mat- ter who i name they tell i no you be wrong he do not do that that one be not there all the face have get mixed up in my mind who do what exactly i can not say when they take i outside there be a whole crowd there but i do not see it because i have my eye close all the time it seem to i that i always get it because of my eye people be always hassle i for some reason it always seem to i that my eye be responsible when they be beat my face i think they be try to put my eye out so i have my eye close they take i outside and start to beat i a young guy 22 hold my arm he work at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from we block 41 be where all this be go on right across the road from we the btz dormitory be over there that be where he live now he be in custody they even have prove as far as i know that it be he who kill shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building be kill it be that man a guy come by who share a room with the guy who be hold i he see that he be hold i by the arm and that he be beat i but he do not come over he just look and then go into the dormitory a while after it be all over people start make announcement in town say that investigator have be summon that guy go and tell they everything now they have catch he everything be be prove now evidently they have be beat he i do not know what they be do with they over there but he himself say that he be work the night shift at the plant some young guy come to the plant and say everyone who want to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that be it he say the one who want to go this be at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it be at night they be at the sauna together and he say what do you mean do you understand what you be say the other be silent probably in their heart they be think i be go to go but they do not say anything to one another he say that he think it important to to go because he have hear a lot about what have happen in kafan that they have kill their azerbaijani sister their mother burn village and all of that that guy be also bear in kafan that be certain and marina say that the secretary of the party organization be from armenia too from i have participate in the investigation a couple of time i be satisfied with they thus far they summon we and ask about what happen and every word i say be record i meet some guy there by the way he be an armenian i say that he be in our apartment but what he do i do not know his last name be grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict 1 he be sentence i think to five year not his first time his mother be russian i meet with he at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they take we there and show i photograph there be so many photograph i think they even photograph those people who be catch at curfew and i have get they all confuse i say the face be about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasp but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like look for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i say he be in our apartment but he be so light complected that he look like a lezgin i do not know what he do i can not remember maybe he beat i or rape i but he be in our apartment at the kgb he start ask i plead with i there be no need for this all this stuff look i in the eye you be like a sister to i i take a look at he and think my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but they be satisfied with my response because i say everything without great certainty i be there with mamma then lyuda come in but when she come in she get sick immediately she want to kill he she crawl over the table at he she recognize he when she come to lyuda be lie on the balcony the mob throw she there and all of they run into the bedroom we have all kind of box with dish in they the dowry for all three sister they steal everything in the apartment leave only small thing at that moment lyuda come to and start remember everything well see the face hear the voice two people be say they could burn the apartment another say why burn the apartment when i have get three kid and no place to live so this guy be in temporary housing he do not have anywhere to live he be from sumgait they be sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbor be azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that be what they say how do they know there be azerbaijanis there if they just pick a place think that armenians live there we have a list of the resident for our part of the building our name be in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis live on the other side of the wall from we so they do not set fire to our apartment i do not know i be in such bad shape that if all of it have come to a halt when i be outside if someone have ask i what be happen i would have say that a civil war be go on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they be beat i i open my eye and see that all the neighbor be stand on their balcony and watching like at a free horror film so a civil war be go on and only the armenians be be fight if it be a world war or something like that they would have be fight everyone but they only fight we then i meet some woman from our building some azerbaijanis they be cry they tell i karina we see all of it how could it happen they be ask i well i just do not know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happen to i i think that if it be the other way around either i would not have be able to take it or i would have try to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman do in front of our building a woman live there an awful dissipate woman if you can call she a woman the dissipate life she lead two armenian family live there in her part of the building she come out on the balcony and see what be happen to i and start to scream and curse she come down to the entryway and say you will come in this entryway over my dead body so not one of they take it in his head to go in that entryway some folk be say that those people be so out of control that they do not even know what they be do i do not think that be true they know very well what they be do if they do not even lift a hand against that woman they could not have care less about she but the fact that she be an azerbaijani stop they they be just beast they have smoke so much when they come to our place they be all chew something i notice everyone who come into the apartment be chew something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i be lose my mind but no they be all chew something maybe it be some kind of drug it must be

put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma i do n't remember where they went what they did or how much time passed i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i do n't even know what i said the atrocities started i was savagely raped in that room they argued among themselves who would go first deposition of karine karina grigorevna m. 1 born 1964 secretary typist azsantekmontazh trust sumgait construction and installation administration secretary of the smu komsomol organization resident at building 17/33b apartment 15 microdistrict no 3 sumgait azerbaijan on the 27th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven o'clock show at the theater that is across from the city party committee about 50 yards away the sk theater they were showing an argentinian film the abyss before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the city party committee but they were silent there 's no conversation whatsoever and we could n't figure out what was going on that is we knew it was about karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we did n't know we bought our tickets there were 30 or 40 people in the theater this was a very small number for that large movie theater the film started about 30 minutes later they stopped the film a crowd burst in about 60 people they came up onto the stage well mostly they were young people from 16 to 23 years old they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to armenian girls i thought that 's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically marina and i were sitting together i told her to move over there were some russian girls sitting nearby so that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not marina it got quiet 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it 's only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their seats everyone in the theater was looking at one another russians azerbaijanis people of various nationalities but no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound they were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave some guy a really fat one says ok we 've scared them enough let 's leave they leave slowly pompously it seemed to me that those people were not themselves either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all the film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive we could barely sit to the end so it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark marina and i were walking home lenin street that 's the center of town lenin street was packed just packed with young people they were shouting something about karabagh and something about armenians we were n't especially listening because the way we were feeling we did n't know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway public transportation was n't running incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there the director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass everything was broken he stood there grief- stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot well since he looked more or less calm i decided that nothing all that super serious had happened we went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away we did n't want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen we flagged down a cab but the driver did n't want to take us we told him we live near the bus station and he said he 'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther i said well ok so we got into the cab and managed to get there something incredible was happening at the bus station there was a traffic jam public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ka ra bagh they 're not going to give up karabagh i go home and tell my family what 's going on and there 's immediate panic in the house mamma says what should we do like the end had come they were going to come kill us that 's it somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up nothing that bad could happen where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have somehow we manage to calm mamma down and we went to bed but no one could sleep everyone made as though nothing had happened that was on saturday in short the day went by we did n't go anywhere and did n't call our relatives no one did anything because life goes on that day i realized something was approaching but what exactly i could n't guess on the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had there were five of us at home mamma papa and us three sisters lyuda marina and i. my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time we sat at home and no one went out later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning it all started they were smashing up stores we were sitting at home and did n't know anything about it then a girlfriend of mine lyuda zimogliad came by at around three o'clock i think we worked together we did our apprenticeships together she 's a russian girl she said that something awful was happening in town i asked do n't they want armenians well what are they after if they 're already in that state she says no nothing like that it 's just a demonstration but it 's awful to watch it somehow it feels like a war has broken out public transportation has been stopped the cabs the buses well it 's just a nightmare then papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time he left the house and our neighbor aunt vera asked him where are you going stop there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard are n't you afraid to go out papa did n't know what she was talking about she simply pushed him back into the entryway he came home and told mamma mamma said well if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on but we did n't go see her she 's a russian she lives across from us i had to see my friend out around five o'clock i tell lyuda ok look it 's time for you to go it 's late already i 'll see you out mamma says you do n't need to go it 's too late already you can see what the situation in town is so we decided to stay home dinner was ready mamma says let her eat with us then she can go we sat down at the table but no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we 're eating we turned on the television and the show in fairy tale land was coming on we cleared the table we hear some noise out in the courtyard i go out on the balcony but i ca n't see what 's going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a 9 story building in the way there is mob of people i ca n't figure out what 's happening they 're shouting something looking somewhere i ca n't make out what is going on i go down to a neighbor she 's an azerbaijani we 've been friends of her family for about 25 years i go down to look from their place i see people shouting looking at the 5 and 9 story buildings near the bus station just then soldiers set upon them about 20 people with clubs the mob runs off in different directions i even see several people from our building they are looking and laughing i decide that means it 's not all that bad if they are laughing it means they 're not killing anyone but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers one of the soldiers can not manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone 's kicking him i become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there ca n't speak well they 've probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is if each of them kicked him just once they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it but it was far away and i could n't see if he got up and left or not i become terrified and go home and say lyuda do n't go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12 story building and starts shouting something we go out onto the balcony all of our neighbors are also out on theirs too everyone is standing staring the mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building as it turns out at the 12 story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in there 's only one entryway there they could stop them they all run up to our building mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones they have stones and they break the windows all of them there are very many people we have a large courtyard and it 's packed with people they spill up to the first floor so they do n't crush each other they crawl up on trees posts and garages it 's just a huge cloud of people they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar it 's incomprehensible mamma told me later that they were shouting father 's name grisha open the door we 've come to kill you or something like that i do n't remember that i was spaced out kind of mamma says into the bedroom quickly in the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry mamma says hide there they probably wo n't come in there they 'll ask something say something and leave she says we 'll tell them that we live alone here i ca n't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts i go to them and say that i 'll stand together with them i 'll talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i ca n't remember if i told her anything or not then they open the door it 's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall the crows bursts in and starts to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia things like that i tell them what has happened speak calmly one of you tell me calmly what has happened in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave i say ok go downstairs we 'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals they must be stopped the ones standing in the doorway the young guys say there are old people and one girl with them too bad they take two or three steps back it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them do n't you understand what you are saying kill them and that was it that was all it took they grab papa carry him into one room and mamma and me into another they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma i do n't remember where they went what they did or how much time passed i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i do n't even know what i said the atrocities started i was savagely raped in that room they argued among themselves who would go first later i remember i came to i do n't know if i 'm dead or alive someone comes in someone tall i think clean shaven in an eskimo dogskin coat balding he looks around at what 's happening at that instant everything stops it seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything depends on him he looks and says well we 're done here they are beating mamma on the head they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs she loses consciousness and they decide that she 's dead papa was out cold they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they ca n't get the window open apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows ca n't be opened they leave her next to the window she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out she 's not a real strong person anyway he looks at me and sees that i 'm saying something that i 'm still twitching well i start saying the opposite of what i should be which is humbling myself and pleading i start shouting cursing they do n't get any entreaty out of me i already know that i 'm dead why would i humble myself before anyone and he says that if that 's what i think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing in short he commands that i be taken outside i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda i do n't know if they are alive or not they take me outside they are dragging me by my arms by my legs they are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal while they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me .i do n't even know i think my god when will death come if only it were sooner then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking me i lose consciousness what happened after that how many people there were i do n't remember i come to after a while i do n't remember how long a neighbor is bringing me clothing i 'm entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me i remember that i said the same words over and over again mamma what happened mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at i ca n't make sense out of anything there is a guy standing over me i sort of know him he served in afghanistan his name is igor he brought me indoors when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though he 's small minded he put himself at risk igor agayev is azerbaijani he served in afghanistan there are three brothers the older brother also served there i think now he 's stationed here on the border in armenia igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying karina i know you calm down i 'm not one of them how do i know who 's who and what 's what i come to and they clean me up i was covered in blood then papa i saw papa i saw mamma and marina too igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed marina lyuda said that she was russian they said we 'll let you go we are n't touching the russians go and while they are dragging marina out she decides she 's going to tell them she 's azerbaijani igor immediately grabs marina 's and lyuda 's hands because he knows marina and knows that she is armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor 's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up she opens the door and igor pushes them in there so they survived my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things while they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor 's on the fourth floor the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door the neighbor opened and said i 'm not going to let you in the apartment because i 'm afraid of them but i 'll give you some stockings and we 'll leave the building lyuda says i 'll stay at your place because of what 's going on they keep going up and down the stairs it was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor would n't consent lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed i came to mother was there i ca n't remember my supervisor 's telephone number but something had to be done somehow i remembered and called and he came to get us he did n't have any idea what was going on he thought we were simply afraid he did n't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death he came and got us and took us to the police precinct there they looked us over i was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe my supervisor 's name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov he 's the head of our administration they took us there when we were leaving i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town the buses were ordinary passenger buses there were very many soldiers we left around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping after us i think 14 people died in microdistrict no 3 and 10 to 12 of them were from buildings 4 5 and 6 in our building one person died and one old woman died from building 16 that 's the building in front of ours there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and would n't let it into their building incidentally when we were at the neighbors marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening i called a aunt in microdistrict no 5 they have three neighbors who are armenians i said run quickly i ca n't explain what 's going on hide do what you can just stay alive hide at azerbaijanis ones who wo n't give you away at that moment three people came in policemen i think they were azerbaijanis i was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one half of my face was pushed out forward no one would have thought that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here have n't you killed people people yet what are you doing here one of the soldiers said do n't scream at us we 're muslims but we 're not from the sumgait police they called in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police were there when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen i do n't know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct i do n't know what they were there for there were also doctors from baku there they examined lyuda and me and said these women need to go to the maternity home but we do n't know what to do with the rest so they took us and i lost contact with my parents my boss everyone my boss said do n't worry i 'll find you no matter where you are no matter what happens we went to the hospital there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name was she examined us the ambulance was from baku i figured out that the sumgait ambulances had n't done anything they did n't respond to any calls people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad i even thought to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong she looks me over and says now why are you suffering so you do n't know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i thought why do n't i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did i just did n't have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours have n't already done i stayed there then they brought in another woman ira b. she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too there were three of us ira lyuda and 1 the next morning they took lyuda and ira away they did n't do anything to help us this was in the old maternity home in the combined block they did n't do anything more than examine me that was it i did n't want any shots or tranquilizer nothing what shots could have calmed me down i did n't even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose but i was alone i was alone even though the wards were packed that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured she asked what had happened to me and i said better to ask your brother what happened there 's no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened she fell into a faint all the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because i was literally naked the only thing i had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said i ca n't believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here i went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work came and brought me something in a sack apples i think three or four pounds but i could n't take them i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing i said that i could n't take the apples and really did n't have any appetite no one had to bring me anything some woman took the sack and oh yes then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian maybe they would n't figure it out from looking at me so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be worse or perhaps someone was outside on the street i do n't know in any case i did n't sleep a wink that night the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went i did n't even know where they were taking me they took me to the club where the troops were the very one i was in that ill fated evening i got off the bus near the city party committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible i saw a few people i knew there and that calmed me a little i had already thought that i was the only one left so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night i still did n't know what happened to my parents they did n't come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine i did n't know whether to believe him or not maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew they all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking what happened what went on two days later they came to see me from work they were there all the time each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money they did everything they could of course i 'm most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who did n't lose his presence of mind and who did n't change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened he constantly took an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two days later the secretary of the party committee came not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours is part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by myself i could n't get up or lie down again there was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe they examined me there several times there i lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows i do n't know they did n't diagnose anything in particular when i was in the maternity home i even asked i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there was no way something inside was n't broken my ribs well they took me there and took x rays and said that everything was fine there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club the mother of one of marina 's friends was there she was the head doctor at the sumgait children 's clinic they had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what i needed at that moment i thought i said that i was having great difficulty breathing i could n't seem to get enough air something was wrong with me they put tight bandages around my chest and waist later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut but i was n't cut they took us to the khimik boarding house we lived there a long time soon appeared representatives they were agitating at first people would not talk to them and drove them off one of the armenian women shouted we demand that seidov come the response was it 's seidov who sent us seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman said we 'll only see seidov 's daughter have her come here we 'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we 'll deal with you agitators and so on more of them said have seidov himself come this went on day in day out the agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay everything got on our nerves the smell the small children there were children at the sk club children who had literally just come out of the maternity home what were they doing in a club that did n't even have running water all the time at first we had to pay to eat there they even overcharged us as it turned out on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free the children were ill everything stank there well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500 you could n't sit or lie down it was impossible to even move the stench was awful even the smallest infants took ill overnight there i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan the infants they have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care people were fainting right and left i just do n't know everyone was crying everyone only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together but the women were in a constant state of panic it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there would n't be a single armenian left then people went up to the attic i did n't see them i only heard them because i was lying down and could n't get up i lay right on the stage we had some room there apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas i think they wanted to burn the theater maybe someone saw them i did n't i was in no condition to open my eyes everyone was suspicious of everyone else they would ask are n't you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think you 're an azerbaijani they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other half of the people did not have any documents there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their ids so on the 28th on sunday i think the police did nothing to help us on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block 41a. they did n't spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody they killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew my mother worked with them their daughter- in law went to school with my older sister they were brutally murdered only the two daughters in law survived by a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors would n't take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge she was pregnant and had two small children this all continued on monday in block 41a on the 29th when the troops were already in the city they murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families they say they did n't even know for sure if the people were armenians or not i heard that the lezgins suffered too i 'm not sure myself i did n't see any lezgins who had been injured they burned cars so it 's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who did n't it was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it 's all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the btz plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift aunt razmella who also lived in microdistrict 3 they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait and people from baku were going home from sumgait and there were students too they were simply savagely murdered they were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stopped the buses dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot i did n't see it myself but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you ca n't call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student ira g. if i 'm not mistaken she was in the hospital a long time after that and she still ca n't figure out who saved her she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city i still ca n't imagine how he managed to do that i heard that from engels grigorian he knows her apparently well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian and they wrote the words down and i think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they could n't find the guy who saved her he left her in someone 's apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she could n't remember anyone 's face i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i had talked with him once but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head i ca n't remember to this day who he was then it seems i saw the secretary of the directorate 's party organization where marina works she goes to school and works she goes to night school at azi and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration i 'm the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations we had joint meetings i know them all i 've even talked with them and he i know is from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia they took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case and i iden- tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize they showed me the people who were in our apartment they 're working on our case but i ca n't even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they 're processing it somehow they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of them as much as i 've heard about them and seen them they were all from kafan the secretary of the party organization is named najaf najaf rzayev he was there when everything started it must have been him because i did n't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him all the more since i told him listen you do something because you know me he turned away and went toward the bedroom where marina was well you could n't see marina anyway there was such a noisy confusion of people that you could n't make out anyone all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i became myself again at the city party committee there were military people there i told them what went on and they wrote it all down i told them his name on march 8 the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we 're part of came to see us his name is najaf rzayev i tell mamma if he 's here despite the fact that i gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think i 'm crazy not responsible for my words he said what did they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different i was n't at home my family and i went to baku i said marina what is he saying he said something totally different before after that i did n't go to see our procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov told me that rzayev 's case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved what are they doing with rzayev did he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i was hit in the head i ca n't say anything for sure whether it was him or not it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and does n't have to pay for it but at the same time i 'm afraid to say i 'm a hundred percent sure that it was he because no mat- ter who i name they tell me no you 're wrong he did n't do that that one was n't there all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind who did what exactly i ca n't say when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but i did n't see it because i had my eyes closed all the time it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out so i had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me a young guy 22 held my arms he works at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from us block 41 is where all this was going on right across the road from us the btz dormitory is over there that 's where he lives now he 's in custody they even have proved as far as i know that it was he who killed shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building was killed it was that man a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he did n't come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory a while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned that guy went and told them everything now they 've caught him everything 's been proved now evidently they 've been beating him i do n't know what they 're doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant some young guy came to the plant and said everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that was it he said the ones who wanted to went this was at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it was at night they were at the sauna together and he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying the others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking i 'm going to go but they did n't say anything to one another he said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that that guy was also born in kafan that is certain and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia too from i 've participated in the investigation a couple of times i 'm satisfied with them thus far they summoned us and asked about what happened and every word i said was recorded i met some guy there by the way he was an armenian i said that he was in our apartment but what he did i do n't know his last name was grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict 1 he was sentenced i think to five years not his first time his mother is russian i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they took us there and showed me photographs there were so many photographs i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and i 've got them all confused i say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i said he was in our apartment but he is so light complected that he looks like a lezgin i do n't know what he did i ca n't remember maybe he beat me or raped me but he was in our apartment at the kgb he started asking me pleading with me there 's no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you 're like a sister to me i took a look at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but they were satisfied with my responses because i said everything without great certainty i was there with mamma then lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately she wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him she recognized him when she came to lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters they stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything well seeing the faces hearing the voices two people were saying they could burn the apartment another says why burn the apartment when i 've got three kids and no place to live so this guy was in temporary housing he did n't have anywhere to live he was from sumgait they were sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbors were azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that 's what they said how did they know there were azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that armenians lived there we have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us so they did n't set fire to our apartment i do n't know i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside if someone had asked me what was happening i would have said that a civil war was going on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film so a civil war was going on and only the armenians were being fought if it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone but they only fought us then i met some women from our building some azerbaijanis they are crying they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen they 're asking me well i just do n't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me i think that if it were the other way around either i would n't have been able to take it or i would have tried to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building a woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads two armenian families live there in her part of the building she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse she came down to the entryway and said you 'll come in this entryway over my dead body so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they did n't even know what they were doing i do n't think that 's true they knew very well what they were doing if they did n't even lift a hand against that woman they could n't have cared less about her but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them they were just beasts they had smoked so much when they came to our place they were all chewing something i noticed everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i 'm losing my mind but no they 're all chewing something maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration but they were shouting something they did n't talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there they screamed and screamed yeah killing killing we 're killing the armenians only they did n't shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary gurun literally means kill or destroy that 's how it was i 'll continue we hid in a captain 's apartment he 's an azerbaijani his wife is a tatar we were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard their kids knew a whole lot this was in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma came to and could n't find lyuda she took papa 's hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they did n't pay attention because they were stealing things apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing mamma found the courage to a boy said to my mother where 's the gold mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old he even looked russian he was so fair skinned but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fair skinned i noticed they were all on the fair side he shouted they were all smashing things and he asks mamma where the gold is we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers in a little black bag we kept everything in there mamma does n't really like to wear gold she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass mamma thinks that the gold saved us because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who was trying to breathe they had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off he had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half awake what 's happened he sees that they are bloody mamma said at least go and find out what 's happening to my daughters even if they 've burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses he went looking for us at that moment lyuda was under the bed she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name when he quietly called her she could n't get out from under the bed she wanted to get out and was calling softly she thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone and again she thought that she had lost her mind i 'll never leave here never to hell with it it just seems that way to me i 'll come to eventually but then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought lyuda down and igor carried me in from outside or first i was brought in then lyuda i do n't remember what order it happened in and mamma said listen they 're all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building it had more or less calmed down where we were who 's dead who 's alive we do n't know i tried to call my girlfriend i had basically come to mamma says listen let 's go upstairs at least get a mattress or something we do n't know how long we 'll be here maybe they did n't burn everything i do n't get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken i tell mamma mamma what do you need any of that for to hell with it we 're alive forget the rest of it all of it she says no let 's go get at least something maybe we 'll leave here spend the night at someone else 's mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son alik was standing on the lookout lie was standing there to see if they were coming they only managed to run up there and grab something one time he shouts come back they 're coming they did n't have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another mamma got my knitting someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall someone took father 's old coveralls the neighbor his wife mamma and papa marina went with them i was in no condition to leave neither was lyuda we just sat they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they 're dragging something again they were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or there was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there then things more or less calmed down i tried to call my boss later there was more noise we were on the third floor in a one bedroom apartment and a woman lives in the one bedroom place on the second floor asya dallakian she 's an old woman retired she was n't at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army she is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant they started pounding on her door and broke it down she had two or three beds in there something like that she 's a 60 to 70 year old woman who really does not even live there probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television when her grandson came she bought a television they started wrecking everything i started getting sick again i think my god what is going on around here when will this end we turned off the lights and sat as it turns out the people who were n't afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights we did n't know but they did n't come to where we were all the same they all knew very well that he was a captain he went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment his last name was kasumov he 's an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other he went out and stood at his door they tell him comrade captain do n't worry we wo n't harm you you 're one of us he went upstairs and they say are n't you taking anything from this apartment he says i do n't need anything and the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again the women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug a guy came downstairs really mad and he says where 's the rug i just put it right here they tell him some guy came and took it and went off toward the school he ran off in that direction oh i forgot the most important point when igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on they just did n't tell me about it for a long time the wife of that military man she did n't want to kill my spirit i was already dead enough later she told me that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said where 's the girl who was here and he became furious the woman tells him she came to she did n't know what to say think something up someone carried her off then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family so the woman says she came to and went to the basement now our basement is full of water so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse they took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil they climbed down in there to get me then one of them said there 's so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died she met her death in the basement that 's it we can leave no problem i did n't know that and when i was told i felt worse two times worse a lot worse so they did n't just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me after that we of course did n't want to live in sumgait any longer we really did n't want to go back to our apartment when we moved i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because i started remembering it all although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap the people who sat in their apartments and did n't help us at a time like that i think that they could have helped i do n't think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself that means they could have too it would have been enough foe one man or women to say what do you think you 're doing that 's all that would have done it there were 60 apartments in our building not one person said it when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i did n't hear anyone 's voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian they would have stood up for one of their own true they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom the azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately the old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said if you want to go on living you 'll disappear into your apartment so she left that trick did n't work on them even the neighbors who helped us move told me ok fine calm down forget that it happened i said i 'd only forget it if i told them right then that it had happened to their daughter and if that did n't have any effect on them then i would forget everything too imagine that it happened to your sister and no one did anything anything april 25 1988 yerevan reference 1

The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who\ndoesn't get in their way: which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do. \nVirtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the \"killing fields\".\n\t(Once again, not to downplay the violence in Timor....)\n\n>> \tIf so, why isn't he in Australia chanting \"no blood for oil\"?\n> \n> Probably because he thinks that this form of protest would be silly\n> and ineffective?

Timor does deserve\nthe attention that Bosnia, Angola, etc. get.  But...I also think that the\n\"press\" can't be forced to print articles, air shows about it, etc.\n\tThe religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started\nbuying their own stations/papers.  The left should do the same thing instead of\nrelying on NPR and public stations.\n\n>> \tIf so, how does he explain (away) the difference between an intended\n>> goal of genocide (Cambodia) and a brutal occupation?\n> \n> I don't think that anyone can ever say for sure what the \"intended\n> goal\" of the Khmer Rouge was.

I don't think\n> that the word \"genocide\" is too strong to apply to either situation.\n\n\tI wouldn't venture that far (to say the situation in E. Timor is\ngenocide).  The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who\ndoesn't get in their way: which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do. \nVirtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the \"killing fields\".\n\t(Once again, not to downplay the violence in Timor....)\n\n>> \tIf so, why isn't he in Australia chanting \"no blood for oil\"?\n> \n> Probably because he thinks that this form of protest would be silly\n> and ineffective?  Or is that explanation too obvious?\n\n\tI don't agree.  Right now Australia is the most effective lever against\nIndonesia.  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor, and\nstopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize that\npeople don't want to see the situation swept under the rug.\n\nBrett\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\t\"There's nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an\nintellectual conviction.\"  Sean O'Casey in _The White Plague_ by Frank Herbert.",

As far as\n  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.

In practice, since any male or female\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\n     provocation is required.\n\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\n\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\n       as document checks.\n\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\n       armed response.\n\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\n       if necessary.\n\n--- D.

Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).
