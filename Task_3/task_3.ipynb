Clearly, occupation is an\n   undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. \n\nOk, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the \nIsraelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.\nFrom your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred\nthat you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the\nreason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of \noccupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this\n'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.\n\n   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to\n   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing\n   Palestinean human rights.\n\nI'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.\n\n\n   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \n   |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n\n   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.\n\nOh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?\nDoes the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and\nTurkey? \nHow about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in\nthe Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?\nDo the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?\n\n\n   |>    |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?\n   |> \n   |>    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem.

Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your \n   |> reply.\n\n   So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.\n   (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).\n\nNo, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper \nwould probably lead to disaster for both parties. If that's what you refer \nto as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it.\n\n   |>    Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) \n   |>    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:\n   |> \t   \"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both\n   |> \t   peoples together in this country....

Clearly, occupation is an\n   undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. \n\nOk, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the \nIsraelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.\nFrom your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred\nthat you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the\nreason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of \noccupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this\n'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.\n\n   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to\n   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing\n   Palestinean human rights.\n\nI'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.\n\n   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \n   |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.\n\nOh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?\nDoes the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and\nTurkey? \nHow about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in\nthe Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?\nDo the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?\n\n   |>    |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?\n   |> \n   |>    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem.

       "\"stuff deleted i wrote are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again hasan replies i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unless you consider yourself deserve less unless you are referring to someone else you have in fact given me a name i did not ask for hence the term name calling so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom i replied if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly /sigh hasan gloats that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey hell bent on retarding into childhood no |>when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that |>the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate |>and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on |>the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i 'm merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i did confuse you i will try not to repeat that to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate ok let me re phrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i 'd like you to define the term so i do n't have to repeat this drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights i 'm sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it if a state can deprive all it 's citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i wo n't repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i 'm eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph no i 'm agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that 's what you refer to as the israeli solution then so be it joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in 1940 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar 29 september 1967 courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that 's the english translations if you have other information i 'd be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i 'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it 's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz oh have you met with them personally to read their diaries fascinating what do you do for a living we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a non solution per definition no you said the following for all a it holds that a have property b. there exists an a such that property b does not hold thus either or both statements must be false guess where that takes your logic to never never land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so am i then to assume you are not logical the greatest problem of zionism is arab children -rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all individuals by a statement of an individual if you use the same methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you oh by the way i 'd advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but i 'll try as long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leaders of israel political and/or religious or the jews in general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in egypt jonas flygare wherever you go there you are v{ktargatan 32 f:621 754 22 uppsala sweden\""
